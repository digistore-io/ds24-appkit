// The consent dialog.
//
// Ships unused: `config/consent.json` declares no purposes, so nothing renders
// this. It exists so that the moment an app DOES need a consent, the shape is
// already decided — because the shape is where consent dialogs go wrong, and
// they go wrong in the same three ways every time.
//
// ── The three rules this component encodes ─────────────────────────────────
//
//  1. **Refusing is exactly as easy as agreeing.** Two buttons, side by side,
//     the same size, neither of them ghosted into the background. Art. 7(1)
//     and (4) GDPR ask whether consent was "freely given", and a grey
//     "decline" link next to a large coloured "accept" is the standard
//     illustration of it not being. That is why neither button is
//     `variant="default"` against a `variant="ghost"` — they are both real.
//
//  2. **Closing the dialog is not agreement.** It records nothing at all. The
//     person is asked again next time, which is mildly annoying and is the
//     correct trade: the alternative is a dialog where the escape key grants
//     permission.
//
//  3. **A refusal is recorded.** It stops the asking (`needsAsking` in
//     `lib/consent/rules.ts`), and it is the evidence that "no" was honoured.
//
// ── What this is NOT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A cookie banner. This asks a SIGNED-IN member about a named purpose. Consent
// for device access by an anonymous visitor (§ 25 TDDDG) is a different
// mechanism with a different store — it cannot be a row against a member who
// does not exist yet. `docs/compliance.md` §2 explains the split.
//
// And note the shipped answer to "do I need one of those?": no. This app sets
// three cookies, all strictly necessary or set by the user's own click. A
// banner where nothing is tracked is a defect, not caution.
