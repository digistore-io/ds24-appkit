// One legal page, whole — header, title, the text, footer.
//
// ── Why every legal page is its own STATIC route ──────────────────────────
// `app/impressum/page.tsx`, `app/datenschutz/page.tsx`, and — once
// `compliance-check` decides you need them — `app/agb/page.tsx` and
// `app/widerruf/page.tsx`. Each is three lines that call this component.
//
// The obvious alternative was one dynamic route, `app/[slug]/page.tsx`, inside
// a `(legal)` route group. It was built that way first and rejected for three
// reasons, in ascending order of weight:
//
//  1. **Parentheses in a path are a tax on every shell command** that touches
//     the tree, and this project has to be workable in a Git Bash on Windows
//     (CLAUDE.md, "Three systems"). A directory nobody can `cd` into without
//     quoting is a directory somebody will get wrong.
//  2. **`node run.mjs smoke` skips `[param]` routes**, because without a real
//     value the request is pointless. So the dynamic version made the legal
//     pages the only public pages in the app that nothing called automatically
//     — exactly the pages whose breakage nobody notices, because nobody reads
//     them until it matters.
//  3. **A root-level `[slug]` claims the whole URL space.** Static routes win,
//     so it worked — but every future top-level route would have been added
//     next to a wildcard that already answers for it.
//
// Static routes cost one three-line file each and remove all three.
//
// ── Public, and that is load-bearing ──────────────────────────────────────
// `proxy.ts` guards `/dashboard/:path*` only, so these are public by default —
// and here the default is the requirement. § 5 DDG wants the Impressum
// *easily recognisable and directly reachable*, and a privacy policy behind a
// sign-in cannot be read by the person deciding whether to sign in.
// **Never add these paths to the matcher.**
