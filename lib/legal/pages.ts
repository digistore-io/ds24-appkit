// The legal pages: which ones exist, and where their text lives.
//
// ── Why the text is a file and not a translation key ──────────────────────
// A privacy policy is three thousand words of prose that changes as a unit. In
// `messages/de.json` it would be one enormous string with escaped newlines,
// diffed as a single line, and `i18n/messages.test.ts` would demand a
// word-perfect English twin before the build went green — which is exactly the
// pressure that produces a machine-translated privacy policy.
//
// So the pattern is `content/knowledge/`, which this template already uses for
// the assistant's handbook: markdown on disk, one file per language, edited by
// whoever writes the text.
//
// ── The slugs are German, and stay German ─────────────────────────────────
// `/impressum` is what a German user, a competitor and a Landesdatenschutz-
// behörde all look for, and § 5 DDG asks for the notice to be *easily
// recognisable*. An `/imprint` that only English speakers find is a worse
// answer to that than a German word in an English page's footer.
//
// ── What ships, and what does not ─────────────────────────────────────────
// Impressum and Datenschutzerklärung ship as PLACEHOLDERS, because every app
// needs both, always — text in `content/legal/`, route in `app/impressum/` and
// `app/datenschutz/`.
//
// AGB and Widerrufsbelehrung ship as NEITHER. Whether you need them depends on
// whether Digistore24 resells for you (`docs/compliance.md` §0), and a terms
// page in an app whose terms are somebody else's is worse than no page at all.
// `compliance-check` creates both halves when the answer says so: the markdown
// **and** a three-line `app/<slug>/page.tsx` beside the two that exist. Their
// slugs are already in the list below so the footer picks them up, and
// `node run.mjs legal-check` knows not to complain about their absence.
